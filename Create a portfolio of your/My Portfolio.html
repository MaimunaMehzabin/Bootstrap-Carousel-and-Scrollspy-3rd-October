      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Hi. I'm Maimuna Mehzabin. I'm a 6th grader at BAF Shaheen College
        Dhaka,Tejgaon. I'm in a family of 4, including Me, my Mother, my younger
        sister and my younger brother. On 16.10.2023 my father passed away due
        to Cardio Respiratory failure and Cardiac Arrest. He was a Computer
        Engineer. My mother being a Housewife. I live in Dhaka, Tejgaon,

      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <h3>Art</h3>
      <p>
        One of my greatest hobbies is art, which allows me to express my
        thoughts and emotions in a creative way. Whether I'm painting colorful
        landscapes, sketching portraits, or experimenting with mixed media, art
        brings me immense joy and satisfaction. I love exploring different
        techniques and styles, always looking for new ways to challenge myself
        and grow as an artist. Creating art not only helps me unwind and relax,
        but it also allows me to share my unique perspective with others.
        Through my artwork, I hope to inspire and connect with people who
        appreciate creativity just as much as I do.
      </p>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>
        Another one of my hobbies is reading, which transports me to different
        worlds and introduces me to fascinating characters. I enjoy diving into
        a variety of genres, from adventurous fantasy novels to insightful
        non-fiction. Each book I read broadens my imagination and deepens my
        understanding of different cultures and experiences. I love the feeling
        of getting lost in a story, where time seems to disappear, and I can
        explore new ideas and perspectives. Reading not only entertains me but
        also inspires my creativity and fuels my curiosity about the world
        around me. Through the pages of a book, I find endless adventures
        waiting to be discovered.

      <h1>My Future Plan</h1>
      <p>
        My future plan is to become a chemical engineer, a goal that excites me
        deeply. I am drawn to this field because it combines my passion for
        science and problem-solving with the opportunity to create innovative
        solutions for real-world challenges. I envision myself working in areas
        such as renewable energy, pharmaceuticals, or materials development,

        of life. To achieve this goal, I plan to pursue a degree in chemical
        engineering and seek internships to gain hands-on experience. I am eager
        to learn from industry professionals and collaborate on projects that
        make a positive impact on society. Ultimately, I hope to use my skills
        to advance technology and contribute to a more sustainable future.
